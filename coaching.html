	&lt;h2&gt;Character Switching&lt;/h2&gt;

	&lt;p&gt; When you knock your opponent to the ground you can do a Z change and then extend your combo from two different characters &lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;h2&gt;Inputs&lt;/h2&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This is a given but you should always remember and practice this imputs in any fighting game.&lt;/p&gt;

	

	&lt;h2&gt;Blocking&lt;/h2&gt;

	&lt;p&gt; Blocking might sound like a simple trick but there is a lot more than you think. In BBCTB there is a move known as clash that is unblockable, so you cannot hold block the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;h2&gt;Dashing&lt;/h2&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Dashing is a necessity if you want to survive online. You can dash in the air by pressing left or right twice in quick succession. Doing this air dash above your opponent will cause you to dash to the other side of them continuing your combo on the opposite side so they can't block your attacks, also this allows you to close the space very fast.&lt;/p&gt;



	&lt;h2&gt;Play Style&lt;/h2&gt;

	&lt;p&gt; There are 5 main types of play styles in BBCTB. Projectile, Melee, Grapple, Techneque, and Tank. Each has its own version on combos and advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
